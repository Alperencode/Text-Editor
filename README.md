# Text Editor

A text editor for UNIX systems, inspired by the [Kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) editor, designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

## Requirements

To build and use the editor, you need to have the following tools installed on your system:

- C compiler
- Make

## Build

To build the editor, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
$ make
```

This will compile the program and automatically execute the `./Text-Editor`. Then removes it after it's done since it does not take any arguments for now.
